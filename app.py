              Welcome to the OCR Challenge! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to harness your inner OCR expertise and decipher the cryptic characters scattered across a mysterious imageâ€”otherwise known as a receipt. Armed with your keen eye and HTML prowess, your task is to meticulously transcribe every symbol, number, and word from the image onto the digital canvas.

                But wait, there's a twist! Not only must you accurately translate the text, but you must also ensure that every character is aligned precisely as it appears on the original receipt. Yes, that means each decimal point, every dollar sign, and all those sneaky spaces must follow the same formatting and arrangement as the enigmatic image.

                Do you have what it takes to conquer the OCR Challenge and emerge victorious? Prepare your HTML tags, sharpen your focus, and dive into the tangled web of characters awaiting your expert scrutiny! """
